# Project Name

This project consists of a Node.js server and a React application. Follow the instructions below to set up and run both parts of the project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

### 2. Install server dependencies

bash
cd server
npm install

### 3. Install client dependencies


## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Node.js server

In the `server` directory:

bash
npm start

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified port).

### 2. Start the React application

In a new terminal window, navigate to the `client` directory:

The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development

- The Node.js server uses nodemon for auto-reloading during development. Any changes to the server code will automatically restart the server.
- The React application uses Create React App's development server, which provides hot-reloading for a smooth development experience.

## Building for Production

### 1. Build the React application

In the `client` directory:

bash
npm run build


This will create a production-ready build in the `client/build` directory.

### 2. Serve the production build

You can serve the production build using the Node.js server. Make sure your server is set up to serve the static files from the `client/build` directory.

## Additional Information

- For more information on the server API, refer to the API documentation (if available).
- For details on the React application structure and components, check the React app's README or documentation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the application, please check the following:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
2. Verify that you're using the correct versions of Node.js and npm.
3. Check if all required environment variables are set correctly.

If problems persist, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
